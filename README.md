# Github Notetaker

####Objectives
The purpose of this project is to familiarize yourself with the Flux architecture. In this project we'll be recreating [THIS](http://reactweek.com/projects/github-notetaker/#/) application. The user can type in any github username and then will be routed to a page where they can see that user's information, repositories, and have the ability to take notes on the specific developer. A use case for this (if you added auth which we won't be doing in this project) is for taking notes on candidates in technical interviews.

As few notes before we get started. Remember, Flux really shines when you have a large, data heavy application. Though we arguably have some data, this application definitely isn't large. Because of that, your first impression of Flux might be that you feel like you're doing a lot of typing without much benefit. Remember, this is just a small demo app. The real benefits of Flux will show themselves as your application gets larger.
